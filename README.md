# hello-world
My first Repository... hopefully not my last.
I have tried my hand at GitHub before, but I did not find much to interest me. 
Giving this another go though, wish me luck!!

I wonder if there is a way to undo your commits? I will have to look into that.

Well, it looks like I can _undo_ a commit, by **reverting the pull request**. That is good to know.
